    "## QUESTION 4\n",
    "a smaller p-value makes the null hypothesis look more ridiculous. Explain why this is in your own words in a way that makes the most sense to you, clarifying the meaning of any technical statistical terminology you use in your answer.\n",
    "* P-value is the probability of finding the observed, or more extreme, results when the null hypothesis of a study question is true. So if the p-value is small, that is means there is small possible that the observed result will happened if the null hypothesis is true. On the other way, the null hypothesis is not a good explanation for whatâ€™s happening in the data, but we assume that is true, sounds rediculous."
